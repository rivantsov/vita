Performance concerns in logging activities
The main concern is impact on performance - avoiding slowing down the main execution thread by logging activities. 
Time consuming activities which are points of concern: 
  a. Formatting log entries
  b. Persisting the formatted entries (plain text)
The solution
To mitigate point 'a' (formatting), we do not format entries into text immediately. Log is implemented as a list/stream of objects containing raw information: 
a message template with arguments array, or DbCommand for db log entries. The entries are formatted into text on a background thread when persisting the log. 
For point b: First, entries are accumulated in chunks and persisted in chunks together. Secondly, the persisting activity 
is delegated to a background thread, which wakes up by a timer and persists all accumulated entries. Entries formatting is also done on a background thread, right when we persist them.
