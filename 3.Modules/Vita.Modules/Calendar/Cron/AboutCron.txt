This folder contains implementation of interpeter for 'cron' input format of Unix/Linux CRON job scheduler: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron

There are a few extensions implemented here: 
1. Additional shift direction specifier for W (workday) symbol. Standard behavior with W specifier - if result date falls on weekend, it is shifted to nearest date (Sat -> Fri, Sun -> Mon), but without crossing month boundary. 
  We add the following additional specifiers: 
    W< - always shift to earlier day (Fri) and allow crossing month boundary
    W> - always shift to Mon and allow crossing month boundary

2. # symbol in Day-of-week field allows specifying occurrence number: Fri#3 - run every third Fri of the month. 
  We extend it by stating that Fri#5 matches the LAST occurrence, #4 if there are only 4 Fri in a month. 
3. Similarly to the previous section, 31 in day field matches the last day of the month if the month has less than 31 days
4. Standard implementation does not allow specifying both Day and DayOfWeek fields. We allow both, so you can schedule to run only on Fri 13, in a months with day 13 being Friday; see CronTests in Extended Unit Tests project. 

Usage: 
  var sched = new CronSchedule("13 13 13 * 5 *"); // run on Fri 13 at 13:13
  var start = new Date(2016, 10, 11); // 11 Oct 2016
  DateTime? next = sched.TryGetNext(start);  // 2017-01-13 Fri 13:13
  // You can call it again to get next date
  var next2 = sched.TryGetNext(next.Value); // 2017-10-13 Fri 13:13
