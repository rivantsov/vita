Not supported: 
  Materialized views (maybe in the future)
  Query with option ForceIgnoreCase; workaround - use 'Orderby b.Title.ToUpper()'
  Oracle SQL does not allow comparing string blobs like book.Abstract = 'some abstract'; also does not allow this columns in GroupBy

Tablespaces:
VITA supports TableSpaces, you can specify tablespace as property on EntityArea object - it will apply to all entities/tables in this area (schema). But tablespace must pre-exist, VITA does not create or delete them.
