## GraphQL sample server application
This folder contains a sample project that implements a GraphQL server running over a VITA-driven database. 
The GraphQL handling is implemented by NGraphQL library. Among other things, the app demonstrates Login functionality - how to implement login thru GraphQL endpoint, and then track the current user using a Jwt token. The token is handled by the VitaWebMiddleware, the same that is used for implementing RESTful APIs.
The AddReview GraphQL method expects the user to be authenticated and sets him/her as the author of the review. 
This project actually implements a combined server, implementing both GraphQL endpoint and RESTful endpoint(s). REST endpoint is used for returning images (book cover image). GraphQL protocol does not provide a way to return binary data directly (so it's usable in image links on web page); so you have to use REST endpoint to return images. In this project books have cover images in the database identified by the CoverImageId field on the Book type. After you retrieve book(s) through GraphQL query, you can get its image as binary stream using the REST endpoint. This endpoint is implemented by the ImageController, defined right in this project.
